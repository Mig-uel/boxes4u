## Boxes4U - E-Commerce Website (Full-Stack Project)

This is my second project in a [QCC Software Engineering Full Stack Web Development bootcamp](https://github.com/Mig-uel/ACE1025) where I built a fully functional **e-commerce web application** using both front-end and back-end technologies. The app simulates a real online shopping experience ‚Äî from product browsing and cart management to user authentication and order confirmation.
The project was developed as part of the curriculum to solidify my understanding of full-stack development concepts and practices.

## üéØ Project Goals

The goal was to bring together the core building blocks of a full-stack application by:

- Creating an interactive, styled front-end
- Building secure and functional back-end routes
- Managing user sessions and validations
- Integrating a relational database
- Delivering a complete e-commerce flow

By completing this project, I now have a strong foundation for building and deploying dynamic, database-driven web applications.
